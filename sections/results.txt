Discussion
 	The results indicate that the hybrid encryption method offers the best security, speed, and efficiency balance for healthcare cloud storage.
Performance:
•	AES: Fastest in encryption/decryption speeds but lacks secure key distribution.
•	RSA: Secure key exchange, but slower performance makes it less practical for large data volumes.
•	Hybrid: Maintains high speeds close to AES while providing secure key exchange through RSA.
Resource Utilization:
•	AES: Lowest CPU and memory usage, ideal for resource-constrained environments.
•	RSA: Higher resource demands may strain systems during peak operations.
•	Hybrid: Moderate resource requirements, acceptable for most healthcare infrastructures.
Security:
•	AES: Vulnerable during key exchange if not managed securely.
•	RSA: Provides secure key exchange but is computationally intensive.
•	Hybrid: Addresses key exchange vulnerability without significant performance loss.
Implications for Healthcare:
•	Data Sensitivity: The hybrid approach enhances the protection of sensitive patient data.
•	Operational Efficiency: Maintains acceptable performance levels for real-time data access.
•	Scalability: Suitable for expanding data storage needs in healthcare organizations.
Limitations
•	Testing Environment: Results may vary in different hardware and network configurations.
•	Attack Simulations: Limited scope due to ethical constraints; real-world attacks could present additional challenges.
